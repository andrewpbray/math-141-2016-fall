#### A

What is the recidivism rate in your home state? Be sure to provide the number,
the precise defition that they're using for recidivism, and a citation.


#### B

In the interactive gizmo, "Who should get parole?" what are the two types of 
errors that can occur in sentencing? Which do you consider to be a more costly
error? Using the thresholds that you settled on, what were your two error
percentages?


#### C

Consider the following quotation:

    Sonja Starr, a University of Michigan law professor who has been a 
    leading opponent of risk assessment, says it isn’t fair. “These
    instruments aren’t about getting judges to individually analyze
    life circumstances of a defendant and their particular risk,” she
    said. “It’s entirely based on statistical generalizations.”
    
    Supporters of the tools counter that judges, parole boards 
    and other decision-makers already make their own risk assessments,
    whether or not they call them that. The difference is that people
    aren’t as good as statistics at predicting who is most likely to
    commit crimes in the future. 
    
What do you find compelling or not convincing in the arguments above?


#### D

Juristictions that have partnered with the Annie E. Casey Foundation have
seen a large drop in the incarceration rates of youth of color. One of their
primary initatives is to encourage risk assessment programs. Does this constitute
evidence that these programs can have a positive effect? Why or why not?
